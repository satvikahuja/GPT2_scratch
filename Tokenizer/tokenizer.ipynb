    "text = \"A Programmer’s Introduction to Unicode March 3, 2017 · Coding · 25 Comments Ｕｎｉｃｏｄｅ! 🅤🅝🅘🅒🅞🅓🅔‽ 🇺‌🇳‌🇮‌🇨‌🇴‌🇩‌🇪! 😄 The very name strikes fear and awe into the hearts of programmers worldwide—we all know we ought to “support Unicode” in our software (whatever that means—like using wchar_t for all the strings, right?), but Unicode can be abstruse, and diving into the thousand-page Unicode Standard plus its dozens of supplementary annexes, reports, and notes can be more than a little intimidating; I don’t blame programmers for still finding the whole thing mysterious, even 30 years after Unicode’s inception—a few months ago, I got interested in Unicode and decided to spend some time learning more about it in detail, and in this article, I’ll give an introduction to it from a programmer’s point of view, focusing on the character set and what’s involved in working with strings and files of Unicode text, although in this article, I’m not going to talk about fonts, text layout/shaping/rendering, or localization in detail—those are separate issues, beyond my scope (and knowledge) here; diversity and inherent complexity: as soon as you start to study Unicode, it becomes clear that it represents a large jump in complexity over character sets like ASCII that you may be more familiar with, and it’s not just that Unicode contains a much larger number of characters, although that’s part of it—Unicode also has a great deal of internal structure, features, and special cases, making it much more than what one might expect a mere “character set” to be, and when confronting all this complexity, especially as an engineer, it’s hard not to find oneself asking, “Why do we need all this? Is this really necessary? Couldn’t it be simplified?”—however, Unicode aims to faithfully represent the entire world’s writing systems, with the Unicode Consortium’s stated goal of “enabling people around the world to use computers in any language,” and as you might imagine, the diversity of written languages is immense: to date, Unicode supports 135 different scripts, covering some 1100 languages, and there’s still a long tail of over 100 unsupported scripts, both modern and historical, which people are still working to add; given this enormous diversity, it’s inevitable that representing it is a complicated project, and Unicode embraces that diversity and accepts the complexity inherent in its mission to include all human writing systems, without making a lot of trade-offs in the name of simplification, even making exceptions to its own rules where necessary to further its mission; moreover, Unicode is committed not just to supporting texts in any single language, but also to letting multiple languages coexist within one text—which introduces even more complexity—most programming languages have libraries available to handle the gory low-level details of text manipulation, but as a programmer, you’ll still need to know about certain Unicode features to know when and how to apply them, and though it may take some time to wrap your head around it all, don’t be discouraged—think about the billions of people for whom your software will be more accessible through supporting text in their language, so embrace the complexity; let’s start with some general orientation: the basic elements of Unicode—its “characters,” although that term isn’t quite right—are called code points, identified by number, customarily written in hexadecimal with the prefix “U+,” such as U+0041 “A” latin capital letter a or U+03B8 “θ” greek small letter theta, with each code point also having a short name and quite a few other properties specified in the Unicode Character Database; the set of all possible code points is called the codespace, consisting of 1,114,112 code points, but only 128,237 of them (about 12% of the codespace) are actually assigned to date, leaving plenty of room for growth, while 137,468 code points are reserved as “private use” areas with no standardized meaning and are available for individual applications to define for their own purposes— to get a feel for how the codespace is laid out, it’s helpful to visualize it as a map of the entire codespace, with one pixel per code point, arranged in tiles for visual coherence (each small square is 16×16 = 256 code points, and each large square is a “plane” of 65,536 code points), with 17 planes altogether; white represents unassigned space, blue is assigned code points, green is private-use areas, and the small red area is surrogates (more on those later)—as you can see, the assigned code points are distributed somewhat sparsely but concentrated in the first three planes, where Plane 0, known as the “Basic Multilingual Plane” (BMP), contains all the characters needed for modern text in any script, including Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Han (Chinese), Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari (Indian), and more (the codespace was originally conceived as a straightforward 16-bit encoding with only 65,536 code points before its expansion to the current size in 1996, but the vast majority of code points in modern text still belong to the BMP); Plane 1 contains historical scripts like Sumerian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, along with emoji and other symbols, while Plane 2 has a large block of less-common and historical Han characters, and the remaining planes are mostly empty except for formatting characters in Plane 14 and private-use areas in planes 15–16; many areas of the codespace were adapted or copied from earlier encodings, such as the first 128 code points of Unicode being a copy of ASCII, which benefits compatibility, making it easy to convert texts from smaller encodings into Unicode and vice versa, as long as no characters outside the smaller encoding are used—an interesting way to visualize the codespace is through a heat map of usage frequency, based on a large sample of text from Wikipedia and Twitter (all languages), showing that most text lies in the BMP, with only scattered usage from planes 1–2, except for emoji, which appear as bright squares in the bottom row of plane 1; since Unicode code points are abstractly identified by their index in the codespace (U+0000 to U+10FFFF), the question arises of how they get represented as bytes in memory or files; storing the code point index as a 32-bit integer (UTF-32) is the most straightforward way but consumes 4 bytes per code point, which is costly in terms of storage, memory, and performance, so compact encodings like UTF-8 and UTF-16 are more commonly used—UTF-8 encodes code points using 1 to 4 bytes based on their index value, with smaller values taking fewer bytes, and its system of binary prefixes helps distinguish between single-byte, multi-byte, and continuation bytes, making it compatible with ASCII; UTF-16, on the other hand, uses 16-bit words, with each code point stored as either 1 or 2 words, employing surrogate pairs for code points outside the BMP; combining marks enable dynamic composition of characters by appending diacritics to base letters, avoiding a combinatorial explosion in the number of code points and making it possible to stack multiple diacritics on a base character, although precomposed code points exist for many common letter-diacritic combinations; canonical equivalence allows multiple representations of the same user-perceived character (e.g., precomposed vs. decomposed forms), and normalization forms like NFD and NFC help standardize strings for comparison purposes—NFD fully decomposes characters into base and combining marks, while NFC precomposes them where possible; grapheme clusters, defined by UAX #29, represent user-perceived characters that may consist of multiple code points, ensuring proper cursor placement, text selection, and string length enforcement without corrupting characters or truncating combining marks; despite its complexity, Unicode is essential for representing the world’s writing systems, offering the potential to create software accessible to billions of users across different languages, so understanding its intricacies is a worthwhile investment for programmers—further reading includes the Unicode Standard, UTF-8 Everywhere Manifesto, Dark corners of Unicode by Eevee, ICU (International Components for Unicode), Python 3 Unicode Howto, and Google Noto Fonts.\""

    "\n",
    "I looked at him irritated and confused. I thought about what that sentence could mean for my business... for my life! After a long pause, I said to him, “That’s ridiculous! Don’t go around spreading such rumours. Business is bad enough!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Abe looked at me and instantly knew that I needed to be left alone. I came to this town with the hopes of starting a new life with a new home, new business, new furniture, new everything. I had changed almost every part of my life, so much so that even if I knew someone from this town, they wouldn’t recognise me. Perhaps I felt my life would change for the better if I started anew. So, I came here, bought a house in the heart of town and just a few blocks away, I bought a store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I was fully settled in my new skin, so to speak, all that remained was an idea for a store and someone to help manage the day-to-day goings-on of the business. At first, I thought of opening a small diner since this was a small town, but I decided to open a toy store named Petits Jouets after some thorough research.\n",
    "\n",
    "An orphanage once stood in the place of my store some years ago, I learned. Tragically, it had burned down in a horrible accident and everyone in it perished. So, I felt like a toy store would honour their memory while also giving me something to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "My old life might have been terrible, but I made enough friends and connections to help me get my new store up and running. My old acquaintances put me in touch with some really wonderful toy makers and helped me arrange for a supply of the latest toys. However, there was a slight hiccup. There already was a toy store in my new town, although it sold only old-fashioned toys. It was owned by an old woman whom everyone called Mrs Greenwich. While she looked as old as mother Earth herself, some claimed that she lost her mind ages ago, during World War II. To me, she seemed sane enough, so I didn’t bother much about the rumours. However, I did everything I could to stay out of her way as her sharp and cunning stare from her sunken bony face always made my skin crawl.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as business started to pick up at Petits Jouets, I hired Abe, my new neighbour's son. Abe was a kindly young fellow who needed a job to fund his college education and I was more than happy to oblige as I found him to be quite trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right about now, I would have loved to say that things got brighter and I lived happily ever after, but the truth is that things took a weird and horrible turn just three months after I opened my store. I had always gotten an eerie feeling while inside the store, but I brushed it away and chalked it all up to an overactive imagination. But there were some things that I just could not ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I opened the store in the morning, I always found some toys lying on the floor in a complete mess. At first, I thought Abe was being sloppy at his job so, I stayed back with him, made sure he kept everything in order before closing shop at night, and only then locked the store. But somehow, the next morning, the place was a mess again. I didn’t know what was going on and was at my wits' end. I thought about asking my friends what to do, but I didn’t want to look stupid in case they didn’t believe me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another odd thing was that Abe’s little sister, who couldn't have been older than 5, would stand outside the store and stare at the stairway right next to the counter as if she was in some kind of trance. This really bothered my customers. Some would walk off without even glancing at the toys that I had worked so hard to procure and line up in a fun display.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What do you keep staring at, Gemma?” I asked the little girl one day.\n",
    "\n",
    "She looked at me with a cold dead stare and turned her gaze back to the stairway. I liked that little girl, but she was downright creepy!\n",
    "\n",
    "I continued to lose customers as no one wanted to even open the door because they felt that there was something wrong with my store. If things did not get better, I would have to shut shop for good and return to my old town like a loser. The very thought of going back home a failure gave me panic attacks. Why did I leave?\n",
    "\n",
    "There was no way I was returning home with my tail between my legs. I was not going to let that happen! I decided to take up revival steps on a war footing and did everything I could to stay in business. I even installed a mechanical pony at the front of the shop to attract the children. But nothing I did worked. I felt like a run-down amusement park that no one found amusing anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somehow, six months passed by and my business was as dry as the Sahara. I was losing hope fast and losing money even faster. I was defeated... but not crushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I was leaving for the store one day, I met the scraggly looking Mrs Greenwich.\n",
    "\n",
    "“They say the souls of those poor children still wander there, she said to me.\n",
    "Where?\n",
    "The orphanage, dearie.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's when I understood why people said she was crazy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There are no such things as ghosts Mrs Greenwich,” I replied.\n",
    "“I’ve seen and heard a lot of things over my long life, dearie; things you can’t even imagine.”\n",
    "“Are you suggesting that you can see these ‘beings’?”\n",
    "“Oh, they call out to me in my sleep! They call out to me for help! 'Save us, save us!' I hear them cry!” she said, her face growing more ghastly with every word that left her trembling lips.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that point in time, I could think of only two explanations: either she had completely lost her marbles or I was losing mine.\"\"\""
